## Changes in DataMiner 10.2.0 CU6

### Enhancements

#### Security enhancements 

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### Cassandra Cluster Migrator: Enhanced resilience of the migration process [ID_33467] [ID_33621] [ID_33727]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

The migration process will now be executed partition by partition. This greatly enhances the overall resilience of that process.

When the source database is a Cassandra database, at the end of a migration process, the Migrator tool will now automatically retry to migrate the partitions that could not be migrated the first time. Moreover, when you manually restart a migration with failed partitions, only those failed partitions will be included in the new migration attempt. The migration will no longer have to be redone from scratch.

Also, additional fail-safes have been built in to cope with situations where the target Cassandra database cannot be reached.

#### NATS: Enhancements to the NATS configuration [ID_33558] [ID_33931]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.8 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the NATS configuration:

- STAN clustering has been removed.

- New NATSForceManualConfig option to disable the automatic reset timer in NATSCustodian.

    Disabling the timer can be done in one of the following ways:

    - Set the SLNet option **NATSForceManualConfig** to true in the SLNetClientTest tool (default = false).
    - Set the **SLNet.NATSForceManualConfig** tag to true in *MaintenanceSettings.xml*.

    > [!NOTE]
    > - Changing this option in the SLNetClientTest tool can be done at run-time. The change will be applied immediately.
    > - Forcing manual configuration will disable the automatic NATS configuration on the DataMiner System. It will then be up to the user to either manually configure a NATS cluster or manually call NatsCustodianResetNatsMessage when changes are made to the DMS.

- On DataMiner startup, NAS and NATS will now automatically be started if they are not running.

Also, the nats-streaming-server binary has been updated to v0.24.6. However, note that it will not be updated automatically via upgrade actions. It will only be installed during fresh NATS installations or when reinstalling NATS via SLEndpointTool_Console. The previous version (v0.22.0) and the new version (v0.24.6) version are compatible and are able to communicate with each other.

#### Dashboards app: Enhanced 'loading' indication when state component linked to a GQI query receives an update [ID_33640]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.8 -->

Up to now, each time a state component linked to a GQI query received an update, a *loading* indication would be displayed over the entire component. From now on, when such a component receives an update, a more subtle loader bar will be displayed instead.

Also, when a query error occur, from now on, the actual error will be displayed instead of "No data".

#### Web apps now also support parameter comments configured in Param.Message elements [ID_33784]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When configuring a parameter in a protocol, you can add a `<Message>` element containing a comment to be displayed in a confirmation box when users change that parameter on the user interface. Up to now, this `<Message>` element was only supported by DataMiner Cube. It is now also supported by web applications like Monitoring and Dashboards.

#### SLPort: Order of parameters in an HTTP session request will be identical to that in the protocol [ID_33796]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

In an HTTP session request, the order of the parameters will now always be identical to that in the protocol.

#### DVE function protocol version of active functions will now be deleted when the main DVE protocol version is deleted [ID_33834]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When a version of a DVE protocol with function DVE protocols is deleted from the system while functions are active, from now on, the function DVE protocol versions associated with those active functions will also be removed from the system.

#### GQI: Table columns of type 'decimal' can now also be used when filtering or aggregating data [ID_33927]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

Table columns of type "decimal" can now also be used when filtering or aggregating data.

### Fixes

#### SLLogCollector would become unresponsive when the name of the process or the path where the files had to be stored contained spaces [ID_33493]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

While collecting log information, SLLogCollector would become unresponsive when the name of the process or the path where the collected files had to be stored contained spaces.

#### GQI: Datetime values in retrieved booking information would incorrectly not be converted to UTC time [ID_33607]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.8 -->

When a GQI query retrieved booking information, the datetime values would incorrectly not be converted to UTC time.

#### Failover: SLNet would return old configuration when that configuration was being updated [ID_33619]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When SLDataMiner or SLDMS requested the Failover configuration from SLNet while that configuration was being updated, in some rare cases, SLNet would incorrectly return the old configuration.

#### SLProtocol would leak memory leak each time a parameter of a replicated element was updated [ID_33745]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

SLProtocol would leak memory each time a parameter of a replicated element was updated.

#### GQI: Columns of type 'decimal' would incorrectly not be treated as columns of type 'numeric' [ID_33792]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

Columns of type "decimal" would incorrectly be treated as columns of type "string" instead of columns of type "numeric".

#### Dynamic virtual elements: Problem when processing table columns containing foreign keys [ID_33810]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When a table contained multiple foreign keys, invalid foreign key values referring to non-existing rows could prevent those rows from being exported to DVE child elements. This would cause alarms, trend information, subscriptions, etc. to not get updated for specific DVE elements and/or virtual functions.

#### Problem with SLElement when resolving foreign keys took a long time and the the element debug log level was equal to or higher than 1 [ID_33826]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When the element debug log level was equal to or higher than 1, an error could occur in SLElement when resolving foreign keys took a long time. 

#### SNMPv3 credentials would incorrectly be checked when replicating an element with SNMPv3 connections [ID_33859]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When you replicated an element with SNMPv3 connections, the SNMPv3 credentials of that element would incorrectly be checked. As a result, alarms like the following one would appear in the Alarm Console:

```txt
Load Element Failed: Error parsing SNMPv3 password for element: <element name>
```
