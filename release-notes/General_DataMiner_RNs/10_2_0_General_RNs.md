## Changes in DataMiner 10.2.0 CU6

### Enhancements

#### Security enhancements 

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### Cassandra Cluster Migrator: Enhanced resilience of the migration process [ID_33467] [ID_33621] [ID_33727]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

The migration process will now be executed partition by partition. This greatly enhances the overall resilience of that process.

When the source database is a Cassandra database, at the end of a migration process, the Migrator tool will now automatically retry to migrate the partitions that could not be migrated the first time. Moreover, when you manually restart a migration with failed partitions, only those failed partitions will be included in the new migration attempt. The migration will no longer have to be redone from scratch.

Also, additional fail-safes have been built in to cope with situations where the target Cassandra database cannot be reached.

#### NATS: Enhancements to the NATS configuration [ID_33558]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.8 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the NATS configuration:

- STAN clustering has been removed.
- New NATSForceManualConfig option to disable the automatic reset timer in NATSCustodian.

    Disabling the timer can be done in one of the following ways:

    - Set the SLNet option **NATSForceManualConfig** to true in the SLNetClientTest tool (default = false).
    - Set the **SLNet.NATSForceManualConfig** tag to true in *MaintenanceSettings.xml*.

    > [!NOTE]
    > - Changing this option in the SLNetClientTest tool can be done at run-time. The change will be applied immediately.
    > - Forcing manual configuration will disable the automatic NATS configuration on the DataMiner System. It will then be up to the user to either manually configure a NATS cluster or manually call NatsCustodianResetNatsMessage when changes are made to the DMS.

- On DataMiner startup, NAS and NATS will now automatically be started if they are not running.

Also, the nats-streaming-server binary has been updated to v0.24.6. However, note that it will not be updated automatically via upgrade actions. It will only be installed during fresh NATS installations or when reinstalling NATS via SLEndpointTool_Console. The previous version (v0.22.0) and the new version (v0.24.6) version are compatible and are able to communicate with each other.

#### Dashboards app: Enhanced 'loading' indication when state component linked to a GQI query receives an update [ID_33640]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.8 -->

Up to now, each time a state component linked to a GQI query received an update, a *loading* indication would be displayed over the entire component. From now on, when such a component receives an update, a more subtle loader bar will be displayed instead.

Also, when a query error occur, from now on, the actual error will be displayed instead of "No data".

#### SLPort: Order of parameters in an HTTP session request will be identical to that in the protocol [ID_33796]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

In an HTTP session request, the order of the parameters will now always be identical to that in the protocol.

#### DVE function protocol version of active functions will now be deleted when the main DVE protocol version is deleted [ID_33834]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When a version of a DVE protocol with function DVE protocols is deleted from the system while functions are active, from now on, the function DVE protocol versions associated with those active functions will also be removed from the system.

### Fixes

#### SLLogCollector would become unresponsive when the name of the process or the path where the files had to be stored contained spaces [ID_33493]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

While collecting log information, SLLogCollector would become unresponsive when the name of the process or the path where the collected files had to be stored contained spaces.

#### GQI: Datetime values in retrieved booking information would incorrectly not be converted to UTC time [ID_33607]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.8 -->

When a GQI query retrieved booking information, the datetime values would incorrectly not be converted to UTC time.

#### SLProtocol would leak memory leak each time a parameter of a replicated element was updated [ID_33745]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

SLProtocol would leak memory each time a parameter of a replicated element was updated.

### SNMPv3 credentials would incorrectly be checked when replicating an element with SNMPv3 connections [ID_33859]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When you replicated an element with SNMPv3 connections, the SNMPv3 credentials of that element would incorrectly be checked. As a result, alarms like the following one would appear in the Alarm Console:

```txt
Load Element Failed: Error parsing SNMPv3 password for element: <element name>
```
