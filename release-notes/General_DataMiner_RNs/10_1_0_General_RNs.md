## Changes in DataMiner 10.1.0 CU18

### Enhancements

#### Security enhancements

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### SLPort: Order of parameters in an HTTP session request will be identical to that in the protocol [ID_33796]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

In an HTTP session request, the order of the parameters will now always be identical to that in the protocol.

#### DVE function protocol version of active functions will now be deleted when the main DVE protocol version is deleted [ID_33834]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When a version of a DVE protocol with function DVE protocols is deleted from the system while functions are active, from now on, the function DVE protocol versions associated with those active functions will also be removed from the system.

### Fixes

#### SLLogCollector would become unresponsive when the name of the process or the path where the files had to be stored contained spaces [ID_33493]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

While collecting log information, SLLogCollector would become unresponsive when the name of the process or the path where the collected files had to be stored contained spaces.

#### SLProtocol would leak memory leak each time a parameter of a replicated element was updated [ID_33745]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

SLProtocol would leak memory each time a parameter of a replicated element was updated.

#### Problem with SLElement when resolving foreign keys took a long time and the the element debug log level was equal to or higher than 1 [ID_33826]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When the element debug log level was equal to or higher than 1, an error could occur in SLElement when resolving foreign keys took a long time. 

#### SNMPv3 credentials would incorrectly be checked when replicating an element with SNMPv3 connections [ID_33859]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When you replicated an element with SNMPv3 connections, the SNMPv3 credentials of that element would incorrectly be checked. As a result, alarms like the following one would appear in the Alarm Console:

```txt
Load Element Failed: Error parsing SNMPv3 password for element: <element name>
```

#### Protocols: Additional connections with a 'Type' defined would incorrectly be ignored [ID_33941]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.0.0 [CU22]/10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

Additional connections that had a `<Type>` defined would incorrectly no longer be taken into account.

In the following example, the second connection would incorrectly be ignored.

```xml
<Connections>
    <Connection id="0" name="HTTP Connection">
        <Type>http</Type>
        ...
    </Connection>
    <Connection id="1" name="WebSocket Interface">
        <Type>http</Type>
        ...
```

> [!NOTE]
> Specifying a type with `<Type>` for one connection and specifying a type with e.g. `<Http>` for another connection is not supported.
