## Changes in DataMiner 10.2.0 CU6

### Enhancements

#### Alarm Console: Time of history sets will now always be converted to the local time zone [ID_33849]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

From now on, the time of history sets will always be converted to the local time zone.

#### Alarm Console - Proactive cap detection: Reduction of false positive matches [ID_33871]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When trend data is often getting close to the low or high value of a data range, this data range value will no longer be considered as a critical data boundary. This will reduce the number of false positive matches.

### Fixes

#### SLAnalytics - Pattern matching: No 'suggestion event' type alarm would be triggered in case of DVE elements [ID_32671]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.5 -->

From DataMiner 10.0.13 onwards, you can activate alarm monitoring of trend patterns, so that a "suggestion event" type alarm is triggered whenever a specific pattern is detected. In case of dynamic virtual elements, in some cases, no "suggestion event" type alarm would be triggered.

#### System Center: Element counter on Agents > Status tab would not be set to 0 when removing all elements from a DMA [ID_33885]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When you go to *System Center > Agents > Status*, the *Elements* column shows you how many elements are being hosted by each agent in the DMS.

When, on a particular agent, you removed all elements, the number of elements of that agent would incorrectly not be set to 0. Instead, it would be set to the last-known number of elements on that agent before the element were removed.

#### Visual Overview: Wait cursor would still be displayed after the scripts had already finished [ID_33911]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When, in Visual Overview, you clicked a shape that executed two Automation scripts, the cursor would incorrectly still be displayed as a wait cursor after the two scripts had already finished.
