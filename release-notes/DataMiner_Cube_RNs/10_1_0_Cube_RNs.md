## Changes in DataMiner 10.1.0 CU18

### Enhancements

#### Alarm Console: Time of history sets will now always be converted to the local time zone [ID_33849]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

From now on, the time of history sets will always be converted to the local time zone.

### Fixes

#### Trending: Creation, update and deletion of a trend pattern would not be communicated to the other DataMiner Agents in the DMS [ID_33624]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU5] - Feature Release Version 10.2.8 -->

When you created, updated or deleted a tag, up to now, this would incorrectly not be communicated to the other DataMiner Agents in the DMS.

#### SLAnalytics - Pattern matching: No 'suggestion event' type alarm would be triggered in case of DVE elements [ID_32671]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.5 -->

From DataMiner 10.0.13 onwards, you can activate alarm monitoring of trend patterns, so that a "suggestion event" type alarm is triggered whenever a specific pattern is detected. In case of dynamic virtual elements, in some cases, no "suggestion event" type alarm would be triggered.

#### Alarm Console would incorrectly keep loading while the tickets linked to the alarms were being loaded [ID_33847]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When you open DataMiner Cube, it will load the alarms and try to link the existing tickets to them so it can show the ticket information in the Alarm Console.

While this process was ongoing, in some rare cases, the Alarm Console would incorrectly keep on loading.

#### Alarm Console: Problem when loading [ID_33860]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

In some cases, an exception could be thrown while the Alarm Console was loading.

#### Alarm Console: Cube could become unresponsive when a large number of alarms were being added and removed in an alarm tab of type 'sliding window' [ID_33870]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When, in an alarm tab of type "sliding window", a large number of alarms were being added and removed, in some cases, DataMiner Cube could become unresponsive.

#### System Center: Element counter on Agents > Status tab would not be set to 0 when removing all elements from a DMA [ID_33885]

<!-- Main Release Version 10.1.0 [CU18]/10.2.0 [CU6] - Feature Release Version 10.2.9 -->

When you go to *System Center > Agents > Status*, the *Elements* column shows you how many elements are being hosted by each agent in the DMS.

When, on a particular agent, you removed all elements, the number of elements of that agent would incorrectly not be set to 0. Instead, it would be set to the last-known number of elements on that agent before the element were removed.
